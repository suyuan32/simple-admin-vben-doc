## Introduction

[Vue-Vben-Admin](https://github.com/vbenjs/vue-vben-admin) is based on [Vue3.0](https://github.com/vuejs/core), [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [Ant-Design-Vue](https://2x.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce-cn/), [TypeScript](https://www .typescriptlang.org/), the goal is to provide an out-of-the-box solution for developing medium and large projects. Including secondary packaging components, utils, hooks, dynamic menu, permission verification, button level permission control and other functions. The project will use a newer front-end technology stack, which can be used as a project startup template to help you quickly build enterprise-level mid- and back-end product prototypes. It can also be used as an example to learn mainstream technologies such as `vue3`, `vite`, `ts`, etc. The project will continue to follow up the latest technology and apply it in the project.
