# test server

There is a simple Node.js test background interface service in the project `/test/server`, implemented with Koa2

## use

```bash

cd ./test/server

# install dependencies
yarn

# run the service
yarn start

```

After the service runs successfully, you can access the test upload interface and websocket interface service
